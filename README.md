# Stocks Tracker

## Summary

The project consists of a stock price tracking app, with scheduled price alerts capabilities. Users are identified by their email and can track multiple stocks at a time. They can individually set a high and low threshold and be notified in case the stock price crosses either via email. The frequency at which the price of a stock is checked can be configured on a per-stock basis.
